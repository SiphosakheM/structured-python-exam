# Senior Apprentice Python Challenge: System Analytics & Data

## Overview
This assessment tests your ability to handle 20 real-world scenarios involving data structures, complex manipulation, recursive algorithms, and professional string reporting. It is designed to bridge the gap between basic syntax and senior-level architectural thinking.

## Project Structure
- `exam.py`: Your workspace. Contains 20 function stubs with TODOs.  
- `test_exam.py`: The automated grading suite.

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the directory.
2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the environment**:
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## Running Tests
To check your progress and see your current score, run the test script. The output will provide a breakdown of your performance:

```bash
python test_exam.py
```

## Challenge Modules
The exam is divided into four technical pillars:

- **Data Structures**: Advanced dictionary synchronization and JSON flattening.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Financial portfolio calculations and data normalization.  
- **Recursion**: Tree searching, deep-nested auditing, and permutation logic.  
- **String Formatting**: Professional reporting, MAC address masking, and SQL generation.  

## Learning Resources
Refer to these resources for technical guidance during the assessment:

- [Official Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) — The definitive source for all library modules.  
- [Real Python: Python Basics](https://realpython.com/tutorials/basics/) — Deep dives into fundamental and intermediate concepts.  

## Scoring
Each question is weighted equally. The grading suite evaluates functionality and returns:

- **Each Question**: 5%  
- **Total Questions**: 20
